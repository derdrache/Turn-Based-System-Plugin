## üöÄ Usage
### Nodes: 

#### <img src="addons/Turn_Based_System/assets/icons/groupControl.png" width="16"/> TurnBasedController Node - Add it to your main scene to activate the Turn Based System


#### <img src="addons/Turn_Based_System/assets/icons/agent.png" width="16"/> TurnBasedAgent Node - Add it to your Character (Player or Enemy)
The Agent needs the character resource where the Commands (attack/skill/item resources) are saved.
The TurnOrderValue will be checked in the character Resource too. <br />
Like this:<br />

<br />

### Command Resource:
For the targeting system and the command menu to work, the skill resource must have certain variables.
There are 2 options for this:

1. you extend your skill with the CommandResource:

2. you put the variables in your skill resource:

### Premade Scenes:

#### Command Menu Scene - Add it in a Canvas Layer at the end of the main scene
The main command list have to be filled to get the Commands in the menu. It's a little complicated
In this List you set a Dictonary with the shown Command name (dict key) and the reference to your character resource (dict value)<br />
Example: [{"Attack": "basicAttack"}, {"Skills": "skills"}, {"Items": "items"}]<br />

#### Turn Order Bar Scene *optional* - Add it in a Canvas Layer at the end of the main scene<br />

#### Character Setup:<br />
